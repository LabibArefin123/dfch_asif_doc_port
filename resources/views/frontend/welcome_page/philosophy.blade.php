                 Every human being is different—and so is every patient. It’s unwise to assume
                 that a single treatment strategy works for everyone. That’s why I don’t
                 follow a one-size-fits-all model. I believe in tailoring the surgical strategy
                 to the individual, not just the diagnosis. I take the time to understand each
                 patient’s specific condition, lifestyle, concerns, and goals, then build a
                 treatment plan that fits them—not the other way around. Personalized
                 care isn’t just better medicine—it’s the only kind I practice.
