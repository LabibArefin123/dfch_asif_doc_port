                    <h5 class="section-title">About Me</h5>

                    <p>
                        I believe that a surgeon’s primary professional responsibility is to correct illness, abnormality,
                        or injury through precise surgical intervention. Surgery is not limited to performing procedures
                        alone;
                        it also involves accurate diagnosis, careful planning, proper training, and comprehensive
                        post-operative care.
                        Ensuring that patients receive complete support throughout their surgical and recovery journey is
                        essential.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I strive to be a compassionate doctor who always considers my patients’ needs and comfort during
                        diagnosis and treatment.
                        I make sure that patients clearly understand their condition, receive relevant information about
                        available treatment options,
                        and participate in deciding the most appropriate treatment plan. I personally oversee every step of
                        the surgical process,
                        from initial planning to recommended aftercare instructions.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I strongly believe that the management of complex surgical cases is best achieved through a
                        multidisciplinary team approach.
                        Seeking a second opinion when necessary fosters collaboration, professional growth, and ultimately
                        ensures the highest
                        standard of patient care.
                    </p>


                    <h5 class="section-title mt-4">General Surgical Experience</h5>

                    <p>
                        I worked as a General Surgeon for four years (2011–2014). During this time, my experience at Mitford
                        Hospital
                        and Dhaka Medical College Hospital provided invaluable exposure to various aspects of general
                        surgical practice.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I had the privilege of working under eminent professors including
                        Prof. (Rtd.) Syed Mahbubul Alam, Prof. (Rtd.) Hashem Bhuiyan, and Prof. Imtiaz Faruk.
                        Since January 2018, I have been working at BIRDEM General Hospital under the guidance of
                        Professor Samiron Kumar Mondol, a renowned laparoscopic general surgeon.
                        There, I gained extensive experience in performing routine general surgeries using laparoscopic
                        techniques.
                    </p>


                    <h5 class="section-title mt-4">Colorectal Surgical Experience</h5>

                    <p>
                        I have been working as a full-time colorectal surgeon since 2015.
                        I had the honor of working with Bangladesh’s first colorectal surgeon,
                        Prof. Dr. AKM Fazlul Haque.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Together, we perform one of the highest volumes of colorectal surgeries in Bangladesh.
                        On average, we see 80–100 patients daily and perform 15–20 anorectal procedures each day
                        for conditions such as piles, fissure, fistula, and pilonidal sinus.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We frequently perform complex pelvic operations for obstructed defecation syndrome,
                        including STARR and ventral rectopexy procedures.
                        Additionally, we carry out a significant number of colorectal cancer surgeries,
                        contributing to advanced colorectal care in Bangladesh.
                    </p>
