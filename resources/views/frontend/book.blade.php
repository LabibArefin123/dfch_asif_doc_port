                    <p>
                        Dr. Asif Almas Haque is an editor of one of the best-selling
                        piles books in Bangladesh. His experience has been shaped by
                        working alongside some of the world’s leading colorectal surgeons.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Piles (hemorrhoids) is a common medical condition in Bangladesh.
                        If left untreated, it may cause severe bleeding, pain and discomfort.
                        Unfortunately, there are very few patient-friendly books that explain
                        the treatment process in a simple and reassuring way.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This book provides clear and detailed information about the
                        different treatment options available — including their risks,
                        benefits, and recovery expectations. It also offers guidance on
                        preventing recurrence and managing symptoms after surgery.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        With comprehensive coverage of piles, fissure, fistula, and
                        colorectal cancer treatments, this book serves as a valuable
                        resource for patients seeking clarity and confidence in their
                        healthcare decisions.
